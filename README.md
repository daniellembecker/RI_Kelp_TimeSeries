# RI_Kelp_TimeSeries

Repository used for data analysis and organization of data collected a larger kelp time series project with the goal of conducting annual monitoring to determine the role of kelps as ecosystem engineers in Narragansett Bay and Rhode Island Sound.

**Significance:**

These data will help inform habitat conservation needs and assist in an ecosystem-based fisheries management approach for state policy-makers that includes essential fish habitat.

**Background:**

In the Northeast U.S., kelps provide nursery and refuge habitat for a myriad of recreationally important fisheries species such as striped bass, tautog, and scup. In Rhode Island, the recreational fisheries industry is valued at over $400 million USD per year. Different aspects of climate change and nutrient dynamics affect kelps, and can therefore have a large impact on ecosystem goods and services, including recreational fisheries. This project uses standardized underwater visual census methods to be able to compare kelp ecosystems in Rhode Island to other ecosystem engineers being monitored by local partners, including oyster reefs, eelgrass beds, salt marshes, and artificial or restored reefs. Annual sampling via SCUBA is conducted at sites across Narragansett Bay to collect data on benthic composition, fish and invertebrate abundance, kelp density, structural complexity, and kelp blade morphometrics. The program serves as an educational opportunity for students at URI as well as scientists at DEM to engage in field research.
